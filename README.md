# React Jack

This is a Blackjack game written with React and Redux.

I am using this project to learn more about Redux. I have been enjoying React but want to get better at mutating my Redux state and discover some best practices.

It was built on `create-react-app` so any of the typical CRA commands should work.

## To Run:

### 1. Clone the Repo

### 2. Install NPM Packages

```
yarn install
```

or

```
npm install
```

### 3. Run Locally in Development Environment

```
yarn start
```

or

```
npm run start
```
